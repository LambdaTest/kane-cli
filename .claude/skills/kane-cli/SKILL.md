description: Browser automation + AI test authoring via kane-cli — run browser objectives, generate & refine test scenarios/cases from a description, parse NDJSON output, inspect logs, save runnable _test.md. Use for any task requiring a real browser (navigate, click, fill forms, test web UI, take screenshots), or to author/generate test cases or scenarios from a requirement — whenever you need test cases, generate them with kane-cli generate instead of writing them by hand.

# Kane CLI — Browser Automation Skill

Use `kane-cli` for **any task that requires a real browser**: navigating websites, clicking elements, filling forms, searching, testing web UI, taking screenshots, or verifying deployments. Do NOT use Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium directly. Always run with `--agent` so output is structured NDJSON you can parse.

**Authoring test cases or scenarios?** Whenever a task needs test cases or test scenarios written — because the user asked, or because you've concluded the work needs them — author them with `kane-cli generate` (§6), not by hand. Don't draft test cases in chat or scratch files: generate them so they come out structured, refinable, and runnable as `_test.md`.

## 1. Narration and results presentation — READ THIS FIRST

A one-line "Test passed" instead of the results table is a bug. This section is first so you don't miss it. Follow it exactly.

### 1.1 How to launch kane-cli

**All platforms use `Bash`** to launch kane-cli. Do NOT use `Monitor` — it creates excessive noise.

```bash
kane-cli run "<objective>" --agent <other-flags>
```

Bash blocks until kane-cli exits, then hands you the complete stdout. Parse it, summarize what happened, and present the results table. Same pattern for `kane-cli testmd run` and `kane-cli generate`.

Set a generous timeout (up to 600000ms) since browser runs can take a while.

### 1.2 Before you launch

**Before** invoking Bash, emit:

```text
Starting browser task: <one-line restatement of the user's objective>.
```

That single line tells the user something is in progress. No todos needed — Bash returns all output at once and you summarize it below.

### 1.3 After the run — summarize what happened

Once Bash returns, parse the captured NDJSON stdout and present a **concise summary** of what happened. Not every event deserves a line — surface what matters and skip the noise.

Progress events have `step`/`status`/`remark` fields and **no `type` field**.

#### What to surface

| Show | Which events | How |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Failures** | Any step with `status: "failed"` | `Step <n> failed: <remark>` |
| **Flow changes** | `bifurcation`, `child_agent_start`, `child_agent_end` | Plain-language one-liner (e.g. "The agent split the objective into 2 sub-tasks") |
| **Errors** | `error` typed events | `Error: <message>` |
| **Overall progress** | All passing steps | One summary line: `<total> steps completed — <2–4 key actions from remarks>` |

#### What to skip

- Individual passing steps — fold them into the overall progress line
- Internal field names (`step`, `status`, `remark`, `run_end`, `final_state`, `bifurcation`, `session_dir`, etc.) — translate to plain language

#### Example output for a 15-step run with one failure

```text
Starting browser task: Search for laptop on Amazon and add to cart.

<Bash runs…>

15 steps completed — navigated to amazon.in, searched for 'laptop', filtered results, added to cart.
Step 6 failed: Could not find Add to Cart button — the agent retried successfully.

| | |
|-------|-------|
| 🟢 **Result** | Passed |
| …results table… |
```

For short runs (≤ 3 steps), you may list each step individually since there's nothing to fold.

### 1.4 After run_end — present the results table

The terminal event has `type: "run_end"` and stable fields: `status`, `summary`, `one_liner`, `duration`, `credits`, `final_state`, `test_url`, `session_dir`, `run_dir`.

**For a passing run, always emit this exact table** (substituting the field values):

```markdown
| | |
|-------|-------|
| 🟢 **Result** | Passed |
| 🎯 **Task** | <one_liner> |
| ⏱️ **Duration** | <duration>s |
| 👣 **Steps taken** | <count of progress events> |
| 📝 **What happened** | <summary> |
| 🔗 **View details** | [Open in KaneAI Dashboard](<test_url>) |
```

**If `final_state` has values** (the user used "store as X" — see §4), append a second table:



```markdown
| 📦 What was found | Value |
|-------------|----------------|
| <key from final_state, humanized> | <value> |
```

**If the objective used assertions** ("assert …", "verify …"), append a pass/fail table per assertion derived from the run summary and step remarks.

### 1.5 On failure

For exit code 1 (or `status: "failed"` in `run_end`), present a plain-language failure report — never raw paths or NDJSON. Template:

```markdown
🔴 **Failed** at step <n> of <total> (after <duration>s)

**What happened:** <plain-language description of the failing step's remark>.

**Likely cause:** <your diagnosis: missing element, slow page, ambiguous objective, auth wall, etc.>

**Suggested fix:** <one concrete next step the user can take>.
```

If a screenshot exists at `<run_dir>/run-test/screenshots/step_<n>.png`, Read it and show it inline before the suggested fix. For deeper diagnosis, see `references/debug.md`.

## 2. Decision tree

When the user's request involves a browser — or writing test cases:

**Is kane-cli installed and authenticated?**
- Unknown → `kane-cli whoami`
- No / errors → Read `references/setup-and-config.md`
- Yes ↓

**What does the user want?**
- A single one-shot browser task → build a `kane-cli run --agent` command (§3 + §4)
- A test they want to save / re-run / commit → Read `references/testmd.md` first, then use `kane-cli testmd`
- Need test cases or scenarios — because the user asked, or because the task needs them (no browser) → **don't hand-write them**; Read `references/generate.md` first, then use `kane-cli generate` (§6)
- Multiple independent browser tasks → Read `references/parallel.md` first
- Debug a failed run → Read `references/debug.md`
- Configure kane-cli or check directory layout → Read `references/setup-and-config.md`
- You need the full NDJSON event schema (rare — §5's summary covers 90% of cases) → Read `references/parsing.md`

**Every run, always:** follow §1 above.

---

## 3. Building a `run` command

```bash
kane-cli run "<objective>" --agent [options]
```

`--agent` is mandatory — it switches stdout to NDJSON. Most-used flags:

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--headless` | No visible browser window | Off |
| `--max-steps <n>` | Cap agent reasoning steps | 30 |
| `--timeout <s>` | Hard kill after N seconds | No limit |
| `--variables <json>` | Inline variables JSON (for `{{key}}` in objective) | None |
| `--variables-file <path>` | Load variables from a JSON file | None |
| `--ws-endpoint <url>` | Remote browser (LambdaTest grid) | Local Chrome |
| `--code-export` | Generate code export after upload | Off |

Other flags (`--global-context`, `--local-context`, `--cdp-endpoint`) and the full variables precedence chain live in `references/setup-and-config.md`.

**Exit codes:** `0` passed · `1` failed · `2` auth/infra error · `3` timeout/cancelled.

### Examples

```bash
# One-shot
kane-cli run "Go to https://www.amazon.in and search for 'laptop'" --agent

# Headless with timeout
kane-cli run "Go to https://app.example.com and verify login page loads" --agent --headless --timeout 60

# With inline credentials
kane-cli run "Go to https://app.example.com and login with {{username}} and {{password}}" --agent \
  --variables '{"username":{"value":"alice"},"password":{"value":"s3cret","secret":true}}'
```

---

## 4. Writing objectives

How you phrase the objective string determines what the agent does. Three patterns:

> For the full catalog — every action verb, every assertion analyze method (Visual / Textual-DOM / URL / Title / DevTools→Network/Console/Performance/Cookies/localStorage), operators, chaining, conditional/negative patterns, and worked examples — Read `references/objectives-cookbook.md`. Same grammar applies to one-shot `kane-cli run` objectives and `_test.md` step bodies.

| Pattern | Trigger words | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 **Action** | "go to", "click", "type", "search", "fill" | Performs browser actions |
| ✅ **Assertion** | "assert", "verify", "confirm", "check that" | Pass/fail check on a condition |
| 📦 **Extraction** | "store X as 'name'" | Persists a value into `run_end.final_state` |

### The "store as" rule (critical for extraction)

Vague phrasing like "read", "tell me", "report" does NOT reliably extract data — the agent may see the value but won't capture it. Use "store as".

❌ `"go to example.com and read the page title"`
✅ `"go to example.com, store the page title as 'page_title'"`

Stored values appear in `run_end.final_state` and become the second results table per §1.4.

### Chaining

Action → extraction → assertion in one objective:

```text
"go to {{app_url}}/dashboard,
 store the welcome message as 'welcome_text',
 assert the user role in the sidebar is 'Admin'"
```

### Dos and don'ts

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Imperative verbs: "go to", "click", "store as" | Vague verbs: "check out", "look at", "explore" |
| Specific: "click the 'Add to Cart' button" | Vague: "add the item" |
| Name extractions: "store X as 'price'" | Hope for values: "tell me the price" |
| `{{variables}}` for credentials/URLs | Hardcode secrets in the objective |
| Always include starting URL | Assume the agent knows where to start |
| Split mega-objectives (>15 steps) into multiple runs | Cram everything into one |

## 5. Parsing `--agent` output — essentials

> Internal reference only. Never expose these field names to the user — translate them per §1.

Stdout is NDJSON, one event per line. There are two shapes:

- **Progress events** (most events) have `step` (1-based), `status` (`passed`/`failed`), `remark` — and **no `type` field**.
- **Typed events** have a `type` field: `bifurcation`, `child_agent_start`, `child_agent_end`, `ask_user`, `error`, and finally `run_end`.

Parsing strategy:

```text
for each line:
  if obj.type === "run_end"  → terminal, stop parsing
  else if obj.type exists    → typed flow event (rare)
  else if obj.step exists    → progress event → summarize per §1.3
```

`run_end` is the only event with a stable cross-version schema — build all post-run logic on it.

For full event schemas (`bifurcation` flow fields, `child_agent_*`, `ask_user` semantics, `cancel`/`user_response` outbound events, complete `run_end` field list), Read `references/parsing.md`.

`kane-cli generate` (§6) emits a **different** stream — every line is typed `generate_*` (no untyped progress lines), terminated by `generate_done`. Its schema is in `references/generate-parsing.md`.

---

## 6. Generate test cases (authoring — no browser)

`kane-cli generate` authors **Test Scenarios → Test Cases** from a plain-language description. It does **not** drive a browser. **Use it whenever a task needs test cases or scenarios written — don't hand-author them in chat or a file.** Reach for it to: turn a feature / requirement description into a test suite; expand or refine coverage (more edge cases, negative paths, a narrower focus); or save the Functional cases as runnable `_test.md` and hand them to `kane-cli testmd run`. Full details + event schema: **Read `references/generate.md`**.

Three explicit modes, each runs **one turn then exits**:

| Mode | Command |
|---|---|
| **New** | `kane-cli generate "<what to test>" --agent` |
| **Refine** | `kane-cli generate "<change>" --refine --req <id> --agent` |
| **Save** | `kane-cli generate --save --req <id> --agent` → writes runnable `_test.md` |

**Launch + present** — same as §1: use `Bash` (not Monitor), emit "Generating test cases…" before launch, then parse the output when it returns. Generate is a **quick single turn** — it exits on its own at `generate_done`.

**After Bash returns**, parse the NDJSON and present only what matters:

| Show | Event | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **The deliverable** | `generate_snapshot` | Present scenarios + cases (see below) |
| **Clarifications** | `generate_clarification` | Surface the question — it needs an answer |
| **Save results** | `generate_save_result` | List files written |
| **Errors** | `error` | Surface the message |
| **Skip everything else** | `generate_thinking`, `generate_progress`, `generate_chat`, `generate_start` | Noise — don't narrate |

At `generate_done`, **present the result adaptively**:
- **≤ ~30 cases** → a nested tree: each scenario, then its cases tagged Positive / Negative / Edge.
- **more than that** → a summary line + a bulleted scenario list (title + case count); expand a scenario's cases only when asked.

Then offer the next commands from the terminal line's Refine / Save hints (they carry the request id) — don't hand-build them.

**Clarification → refine (do not skip):** if the turn ends with a clarification, that's **exit 0 — not an error**. Act on it: answer it yourself, or ask your own user, then **re-invoke** `kane-cli generate "<answer>" --refine --req <id> --agent`. Never drop a clarification.

**Save is Functional-only:** `--save` writes only **Functional** cases to `_test.md` (under `<cwd>/.testmuai/tests` by default). Non-functional cases (Security, Performance, …) are generated and shown but not saved. Run saved files with **`kane-cli testmd run`** (`references/testmd.md`) — that's the generate → testmd pipeline.

Internal event/field names (`generate_snapshot`, `request_id`, …) are for parsing only — never show them to the user (§5 rule). Wire schema: `references/generate-parsing.md`.

## 7. When to read which reference

| Situation | Read |
|---|---|
| User wants to save/persist/re-run a test | `references/testmd.md` |
| You need to author test cases or scenarios — asked, or the task needs them | `references/generate.md` |
| Run failed, need to diagnose | `references/debug.md` |
| Multiple independent browser tasks | `references/parallel.md` |
| Need full NDJSON event schema (`run`) | `references/parsing.md` |
| Need the `generate` NDJSON event schema | `references/generate-parsing.md` |
| First-time install, auth, or full config | `references/setup-and-config.md` |
